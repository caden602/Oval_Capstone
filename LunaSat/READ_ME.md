# This is the READ_ME.md for the LunaSat sub-folder

Here we have a LunaSat.ino file which is the main file to upload to our LunaSat. We have a header file that links up to several of the other sensor header files inside the sensor sub-folder here. For each sensor there is a setup and get data function that can be called from within LunaSat.ino.

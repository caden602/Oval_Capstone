04/16 Debug Notes

Noticed that LIS stops sending accurate data after its 13th sample.

ie it will send 13 correc measurments and then still sends decent looking data but not what we had measured.

Also noticed a glitch where LIS will send ADXL data for some reason.
During this glitch there was no bme data sent or sampled from LunaSat.

Check why BME sometimes doesn't sample 

Also check why the data stops being any good.

Running out of local var storage and data starts to reset sometimes. Need 600+ bytes of local storage.



Everything after first byte of last page being sent is incorrect data / off by a little.

The data is actually the data of the previous page after the first data pt.
